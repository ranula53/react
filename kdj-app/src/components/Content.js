      "A business leader standing at a crossroads with four different paths, each labeled with a management style: 'Autocratic,' 'Democratic,' 'Laissez-faire,' and 'Transformational.' The paths have different visual representations: a strict, structured path for Autocratic, a group discussion for Democratic, an open, free-flowing road for Laissez-faire, and a bright, inspiring path for Transformational. The background symbolizes decision-making and leadership, with arrows pointing toward success."
